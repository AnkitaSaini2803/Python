# How to emulate do while loop in python?

i=int(input("Enter the number"))
# while(i<=5): {If i will write only this two lines of code then infinite loop}
    # print(i)
while(i<=30):
    print(i)
    i=i+1
else:
    print('You are out of the loop')    

count=10
while(count>0):
    print(count)
    count=count-1
print("You are outside of loop")
